# The ultimate memory test!

## How To Play?

Get presented with a new memorization challenge each round. With an increasing number of unique playing cards each round, your memorization skills will be put to the test. You can only click on a unique playing card once, clicking the same card twice will result in a game over. Each card clicked will bring your score up!

Clicking every unique card once in the set will allow you to advance to a new level. With each new level the cards are re-shuffled and,
for an extra challenge, a brand new unique card is added to the set. How long can you keep it up?

Try to beat your personal best score or compete with your friends and family!

## Extremely Customizable1
